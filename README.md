Flask is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py.

Flask-CORS is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

Database Setup:
  Manually create database using PgAdmin4 named as trivia;

  Create two tables named as Questions and Categories;

  Question Table Querry:
  

  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.questions

    id integer NOT NULL GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY ( INCREMENT 1 START 1 MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 2147483647 CACHE 1 ),
    question text COLLATE pg_catalog."default",

    CONSTRAINT questions_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
    CONSTRAINT questions_category_fkey FOREIGN KEY (category)
        REFERENCES public.categories (id) MATCH SIMPLE
        ON UPDATE NO ACTION
        ON DELETE NO ACTION
        NOT VALID
